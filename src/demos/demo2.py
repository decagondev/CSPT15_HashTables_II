"""
Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.
Example 1:
```plaintext
Input:
"free"
Output:
"eefr"
Explanation:
'e' appears twice while 'f' and 'r' appear once.
So 'e' must appear before 'f' and 'r'. Therefore, "eerf" is also a valid answer.
```
Example 2:
```plaintext
Input:
"dddbbb"
Output:
"dddbbb"
Explanation:
Both 'd' and 'b' appear three times, so "bbbddd" is also a valid answer.
Note that "dbdbdb" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
```
Example 3:
```plaintext
Input:
"Bbcc"
Output:
"ccBb"
Explanation:
"ccbB" is also a valid answer, but "Bbcc" is incorrect.
Note that 'B' and 'b' are treated as two different characters.
